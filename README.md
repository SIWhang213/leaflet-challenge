##This is Module 15 Challenge.  

### Goal: Create the Earthquake Visualization
### Instructions
1. Get the necessary dataset. 
* The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every minute. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed
(http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and choose a dataset to visualize.
* When you click a dataset (such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days"), you will be given a JSON representation of that data. Use the URL of this JSON to
pull in the data for the visualization.
2. Import and visualize the data by doing the following:
* Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
* Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher
magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
(Hint: The depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.)
* Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
* Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.
  
### Attached folders and files :
* one folder named static including css folder and js folder. 
* one html file (index.html) 
* one REDME file
